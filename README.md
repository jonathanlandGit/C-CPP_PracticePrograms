# CPP Practice Programs
These practice programs are a combination of programming exercises. Some of them are exercises from the book, C++ Primer Plus by Stephen Prata. These all begin with PE followed by the specific program number in the book chapters. The other programs are from coursework related to parallel programming, as well as other master's level CS courses.
