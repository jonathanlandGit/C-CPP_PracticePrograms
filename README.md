# CPP Practice Programs
These practice programs are a combination of programming exercises, one of which is C++ Primer Plus by Stephen Prata. The Primer Plus programs all begin with PE followed by the specific program number in the book chapters. The other programs are from coursework related to parallel programming, and other programs.
